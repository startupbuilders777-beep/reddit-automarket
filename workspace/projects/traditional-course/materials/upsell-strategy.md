# Upsell Strategy: From Free Course to Whop Course

## Converting Free Students into Paying Whop Customers

---

## UNDERSTANDING THE AUDIENCE

### Who Are These People?

Your free course students are:
- **55-75+ years old**
- **New to AI** - never used ChatGPT or similar tools
- **Curious but cautious** - interested but potentially nervous
- **Value-conscious** - want to make sure it's worth paying for
- **Relationship-driven** - need trust before purchasing
- **Not impulse buyers** - will take time to decide

### What Do They Need?

Based on the course, they need:
1. **More depth** - The free course gives overview; they want practical skills
2. **Reassurance** - Confirmation they're doing things right
3. **Support** - Someone to turn to if they get stuck
4. **Structure** - A clear path to follow
5. **Community** - Others like them to learn with

**Email 3: Addressing Concerns**

Subject: "Not sure if the paid course is right for you?"

Hi [Name],

It's totally normal to want to make sure something is worth the investment.

Here's what I'd ask yourself:

✓ Do I want to use AI for more than just basic questions?
✓ Would downloadable guides help me remember what I learned?
✓ Would I like support if I get stuck?
✓ Do I want a certificate to show my grandkids?

If you answered "yes" to any of these, the premium course might be perfect for you.

And here's our promise: If you're not satisfied within 30 days, let us know. We'll refund your money. No questions asked.
