It happens at every family dinner. Your grandkids are excited about something called "AI" or "ChatGPT" — and you're left nodding along, pretending you know what they mean.

**Here's the truth:** Understanding AI isn't as hard as it seems. You already know how to use email and browse the internet. Learning to use AI is just one small step further.

### Option B: The Practical Benefits Angle

**Headline:**
"AI Isn't Just for Techies. It's for Anyone Who Wants a Little Extra Help."

**Body:**
What if you had a helpful friend available 24/7 to answer questions, help with recipes, or plan your next trip?

That's exactly what AI can do — and you don't need to be tech-savvy to use it.

**AI for Beginners** teaches you:

• How to use ChatGPT (free!) to get quick answers
• Simple ways AI can help with everyday tasks

**Headline:**
"Don't Let the AI Revolution Pass You By. It's Easier Than You Think.**

**Body:**
The world is changing. AI is in the news, in your grandkids' conversations, and increasingly in everyday life.

But here's what most people don't realize: You don't need a computer degree to use AI. You just need someone to show you how — in words you actually understand.

## LONG-FORM SALES LETTER (For Landing Page)

### The Letter

Dear Friend,

Have you ever sat in a room while your grandkids excitedly talked about something called "AI" or "ChatGPT" — and nodded along, pretending you knew what they meant?

You're not alone.

Every day, thousands of people just like you feel left behind by the rapid pace of technology. The younger generation seems to speak a different language. And honestly, it's frustrating.

But here's what I want you to know:

**You haven't missed anything. And it's not too late.**

AI — artificial intelligence — sounds complicated. But at its core, it's simply a helpful tool. And you can learn to use it.

I created this course specifically for people who:

• Are 55 or older
• Have never used AI before
• Know how to send an email and browse the web
• Want to understand what the fuss is all about
• Might want to use AI for recipes, travel planning, or just satisfying their curiosity

**You don't need to be tech-savvy. You just need someone to explain it in words you actually understand.**

This course has 5 short video modules, each one designed to be:
✓ Clear and easy to follow
✓ Free of confusing jargon
✓ Patient and encouraging in tone
✓ Filled with real, practical examples

**Module 1:** What on earth is AI? (The simple explanation)
**Module 2:** Meeting ChatGPT — creating your account and sending your first message
**Module 3:** Using AI for real life — recipes, travel, emails, and more
**Module 4:** Staying safe online — privacy and common sense
**Module 5:** The future is here — what's coming next

**Best of all? The first module is completely free.**

No credit card required. No commitment. Just you, learning at your own pace, with a friendly voice guiding you through every step.

So the next time your grandkids start talking about AI, you'll not only understand — you might even have some tricks to show them.

With warmth,

**Your AI Guide**

P.S. "I was skeptical at first, but I'm so glad I tried it. Now I use AI every week!" — Margaret, 61
