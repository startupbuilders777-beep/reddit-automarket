### OPENING SCENE

**[VISUAL: Warm, inviting living room. A friendly host sits in a comfortable chair, smiling at the camera]**

**HOST (warm, conversational tone):**
"Welcome back! In our last lesson, we talked about what AI is. Today, we're going to meet a specific AI tool called ChatGPT. This is one of the most popular AI tools in the world, and by the end of this video, you'll know exactly how to use it.

And here's the best part: it's free to start, and I'll walk you through every single step."

**[VISUAL: Text on screen: "Module 2: Meeting ChatGPT"]**

**HOST:**
"By the end of this lesson, you'll have created your own ChatGPT account and sent your first message. Let's get started!"

### SECTION 1: What is ChatGPT?

**[VISUAL: Host sitting forward, explaining clearly]**

**HOST:**
"First, let's talk about what ChatGPT actually is.

ChatGPT is an AI tool that you can talk to like a person. You type a question or a request, and ChatGPT types back an answer. It's like texting with a very knowledgeable friend who is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week."

**[VISUAL: Simple animation showing a person typing a question on one side, and ChatGPT responding on the other]**

**HOST:**
"The name 'ChatGPT' comes from:
- **Chat** = talking or messaging
- **G** = Generative (it generates or creates responses)
- **P** = Pre-trained (it's been trained on lots of information)
- **T** = Transformer (a type of computer program)

But you don't need to remember any of that! Just think of it as your helpful chat friend."

**[VISUAL: Friendly robot icon with a speech bubble]**

**HOST:**
"What can ChatGPT help you with? Lots of things:

- Answering questions
- Explaining complicated topics simply
- Helping write emails or letters
- Suggesting recipes
- Planning trips
- Brainstorming ideas
- And much more!"

### SECTION 2: Creating Your ChatGPT Account

**[VISUAL: Host looking at what appears to be a laptop screen, pointing to different areas]**

**HOST:**
"Now, let's create your ChatGPT account. I'll walk you through this step by step. Take your time — there's no rush."

**STEP 1: Open Your Web Browser**

**HOST:**
"First, open whichever web browser you normally use — whether that's Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge. You probably already have it on your computer.

**[SCREENSHOT DESCRIPTION 1: Chrome browser with an empty address bar at the top. A hand cursor hovers over the address bar. The address bar is highlighted with a faint yellow glow to show it's selected.]**

Just click in the address bar at the top — that's where you type website addresses."

**STEP 2: Go to the ChatGPT Website**

**HOST:**
"Now, here's the important part. You're going to type a website address.

**[SCREENSHOT DESCRIPTION 2: Address bar being typed into, showing "chat.openai.com" appearing letter by letter. The text is shown in large, clear font.]**

Type exactly this: **chat.openai.com**

That's C-H-A-T — dot — O-P-E-N-A-I — dot C-O-M.

Then press Enter on your keyboard."

**STEP 3: Look for the Sign-Up Page**

**[SCREENSHOT DESCRIPTION 3: The ChatGPT login/signup page. At the top, there's a logo that looks like a speech bubble with dots inside. Below that, there are two big buttons: one green button saying "Sign up" and another option saying "Log in." The page is clean and white with minimal text.]**

**HOST:**
"After you press Enter, a new page will load. It might take a few seconds — that's normal!

What you're looking for is a page with two main buttons:
- A green button that says "Sign up"
- And probably a way to log in if you already have an account

Since you're new, click the green 'Sign up' button."

**STEP 4: Choose How to Sign Up**

**[SCREENSHOT DESCRIPTION 4: The signup options screen. There are several ways to create an account, shown as buttons with logos: one with a Google logo (the colorful "G"), one with a Microsoft logo, one with an Apple logo, and at the bottom, an option to "Sign up with email" which shows an envelope icon.]**

**HOST:**
"Now you'll see several options for creating your account. You can use:

- **Google** — if you have a Gmail account
- **Microsoft** — if you have an Outlook or Hotmail account
- **Apple** — if you have an iPhone or Mac
- **Email** — if you just want to use your regular email

**[HOST advice: "My recommendation is to use the same account you already use for email. If you have Gmail, use Google. If you use Outlook, use Microsoft. It makes everything easier."]**

**STEP 5: If Using Email**

**[SCREENSHOT DESCRIPTION 5: The email signup form. There's a field labeled "Email" with a cursor blinking inside. Below it, a green button says "Continue."]**

**HOST:**
"If you choose to sign up with email, enter your email address in the box.

Then click 'Continue.'

You'll be asked to create a password. Make sure it's something you can remember — at least 8 characters with a mix of letters and numbers."

**STEP 6: Verify Your Email**

**[SCREENSHOT DESCRIPTION 6: A simple message screen that says "Check your email" with text explaining that a verification email has been sent. There's an envelope icon at the top.]**

**HOST:**
"After you create your password, ChatGPT will send you an email to verify your address.

Go to your email inbox — the same one you just typed in — and look for an email from OpenAI (that's the company that makes ChatGPT).

Click the link inside that email to verify your account. It should take you back to ChatGPT."

### SECTION 3: Getting Started with ChatGPT

**[VISUAL: Host looking pleased and excited]**

**HOST:**
"Congratulations! You've created your ChatGPT account. Now let's learn how to use it."

**STEP 1: The ChatGPT Interface**

**[SCREENSHOT DESCRIPTION 7: The main ChatGPT screen after logging in. At the very top left, there's a small menu button (three horizontal lines). In the middle of the screen, there's a large text box at the bottom that says "Message ChatGPT..." in gray text. Above that, there's a green button labeled "Send." On the left side of the screen (about 1/4 of the width), there's a dark sidebar showing "ChatGPT" at the top, then "New Chat" button, then a list of past conversations. The main area is white/light gray.]**

**HOST:**
"Let's look at the main screen. Here's what you'll see:

**At the bottom:** A text box where you can type your message. It probably says 'Message ChatGPT...' in gray text. This is where you type your questions.

**A green 'Send' button:** Right next to the text box. You click this to send your message.

**On the left side:** A sidebar with your chat history. Every conversation you have will show up here. At the top, there's a button that says 'New Chat' — that's for starting a fresh conversation.

**In the middle:** That's where ChatGPT's responses will appear."

**[SCREENSHOT DESCRIPTION 8: Close-up of the message input area at the bottom. The text box is highlighted with a yellow outline. Inside the box, the cursor blinks. To the right of the box, there's a green rounded button with an upward-pointing arrow.]**

**HOST:**
"The most important thing is this text box at the bottom. That's where you type your questions. Think of it like typing an email, but you're sending it to ChatGPT."

---

### SECTION 4: Your First Conversation

**[VISUAL: Host with an encouraging smile]**

**HOST:**
"Now for the fun part — let's send your first message to ChatGPT!"

**STEP 1: Type Your First Question**

**[SCREENSHOT DESCRIPTION 9: The message box with text already typed in. The text reads: "Hello! I'm new to ChatGPT. Can you help me understand what you can do?" The text is shown in large, clear font inside the input box.]**

**HOST:**
"In the text box at the bottom, type a simple message to start. You could type something like:

**'Hello! I'm new to ChatGPT. Can you help me understand what you can do?'**

Or keep it even simpler and just type:

**'Hi, what can you help me with?'**

Type whatever feels comfortable to you."

**STEP 2: Send Your Message**

**[SCREENSHOT DESCRIPTION 10: The same message box, now with the green "Send" button highlighted. An arrow points from the button, indicating it's ready to be clicked.]**

**HOST:**
"After you type your message, click the green 'Send' button. It's right next to the text box — you can't miss it!

Alternatively, you can just press the Enter key on your keyboard."

**STEP 3: Read the Response**

**[SCREENSHOT DESCRIPTION 11: The main chat area showing a conversation. On the left (in a slightly different color box), the user's message: "Hello! I'm new to ChatGPT. Can you help me understand what you can do?" On the right (in the main white area), ChatGPT's response appears. It starts with a friendly greeting and then lists things ChatGPT can help with: answering questions, helping with writing, explaining concepts, brainstorming ideas, and more. The text is well-formatted with bullet points. There's a small "thumbs up" and "thumbs down" icon at the bottom of ChatGPT's message.]**

**HOST:**
"Now here's the exciting part — wait for ChatGPT's response!

It might take 1-3 seconds. You'll see the response appear on your screen, right below your question.

ChatGPT will greet you warmly and explain what it can help with. It might say something like:

*'Hello! I'm so glad you're here. I'd be happy to help! I can answer questions, help you write emails, explain complicated topics, suggest recipes, plan trips, and much more. Just ask me anything!'*"

**[HOST tip: "Notice at the bottom of ChatGPT's response, there might be little thumbs up and thumbs down icons. That's how you can tell ChatGPT if its response was helpful or not. You don't have to use these yet, but they're there if you want to."]**

### SECTION 5: A Few More Examples

**[VISUAL: Host looking engaged and enthusiastic]**

**HOST:**
"Once you've sent your first message, try a few more! Here are some simple questions to practice with:"

**[VISUAL: Screen showing examples appearing one by one]**

**HOST:**
"**Example 1: Asking for help with cooking**
You could type: *'What can I make for dinner with chicken and broccoli?'*

ChatGPT will suggest recipes using those ingredients."

**HOST:**
"**Example 2: Asking for explanations**
You could type: *'Can you explain what the stock market is in simple terms?'*

ChatGPT will break down complicated topics into easier-to-understand language."

**HOST:**
"**Example 3: Getting travel ideas**
You could type: *'What are some good places to visit in Florida for a family trip?'*

ChatGPT will give you suggestions with reasons."

**HOST:**
"**Example 4: Helping with writing**
You could type: *'Help me write a birthday message for my grandson who just turned 21'*

ChatGPT will help you craft a nice message that you can then personalize."

**[VISUAL: Host with a knowing smile]**

**HOST:**
"See? ChatGPT is like having a helpful friend available any time. You can ask it almost anything!"

### SECTION 6: What to Avoid

**[VISUAL: Host with a slightly more serious expression, but still warm]**

**HOST:**
"Before we finish, let's talk about what you should NOT do with ChatGPT. This is important for your safety."

**RULE 1: Never Share Personal Information**

**[VISUAL: Simple icon of a lock]**

**HOST:**
"Don't share:
- Your full name and address together
- Your phone number
- Your Social Security number
- Your bank account or credit card information
- Passwords to any of your accounts
- Medical information about yourself

ChatGPT is a computer program. Even though it feels like talking to a person, it's not a person you know and trust. Keep your private information private."

**RULE 2: Don't Believe Everything Automatically**

**[VISUAL: Simple icon of a question mark]**

**HOST:**
"ChatGPT can sometimes give wrong information — especially about:
- Current news (it might not know about something that happened this week)
- Medical or legal advice (always consult a real professional)
- Very specific facts (it might mix things up occasionally)

**Always use your judgment.** If something sounds important or involves money, health, or legal matters, double-check with a real expert."

**RULE 3: Keep Conversations Light**

**[VISUAL: Simple icon of a smiley face]**

**HOST:**
"ChatGPT is great for:
- General questions
- Helping with everyday tasks
- Learning new things
- Having a chat

It's not designed to be a substitute for human relationships or professional help. It's a tool — a helpful one, but just a tool."
