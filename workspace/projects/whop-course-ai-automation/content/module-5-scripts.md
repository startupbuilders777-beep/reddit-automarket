```

### Lesson 5.2: Pricing Your AI Services (12 minutes)

**[INTRO - 1 min]**

This is the most important lesson for your business. Pricing determines your success.

You'll learn:
- Pricing models
- How to calculate your rates
- Positioning for premium prices

Let's go.

**[PRICING MODELS - 3 min]**

**Model 1: Hourly**
```
$50-150/hour
```
- Easiest to start
- But limits your income
- Clients push back on hours
- Hard to scale

**Model 2: Project-Based**
```
$500-5,000 per project
```
- Clear scope
- One-time revenue
- Risk of scope creep
- Needs good scoping skills

**Model 3: Retainer (Recommended)**
```
$500-5,000/month
```
- Recurring revenue
- Predictable income
- Better client relationships
- Requires ongoing value

**Model 4: Usage-Based**
```
$0.01 per message, $0.10 per API call
```
- Aligns with costs
- Harder to predict
- Good for high-volume

**Best for most:** Retainer model

**[HOW TO CALCULATE YOUR RATES - 3 min]**

**Step 1: Calculate your target income**

```
Annual target: $120,000
+ Taxes (30%): $36,000
+ Business expenses: $24,000
= Total needed: $180,000
```

**Step 2: Determine billable hours**

```
52 weeks × 40 hours = 2,080 hours
- Training/learning: 200 hours
- Admin/marketing: 300 hours
- Vacations/holidays: 300 hours
= Billable hours: 1,280
```

**Step 3: Calculate base rate**

```
$180,000 ÷ 1,280 = $140/hour
```

**Step 4: Add margin and adjust**

```
$140 × 1.5 (buffer) = $210/hour
Round to: $200/hour
```

**For retainer pricing:**
- 20-40 hours/month = $4,000-8,000/month
- Start at $2,000/month minimum

**[PREMIUM PRICING STRATEGY - 3 min]**

Here's the secret: Charge more, serve fewer clients.

**Why premium works:**
- Better clients
- Less price shopping
- More respect
- Higher margins
- Easier to deliver

**How to position for premium:**

1. **Specialize**
   ```
   "I help SaaS companies automate customer support"
   vs
   "I help businesses with automation"
   ```

2. **Show results**
   ```
   "I help you save 20 hours/week"
   vs
   "I set up AI agents"
   ```

3. **Add guarantees**
   ```
   "Pay only if you're satisfied after 30 days"
   ```

4. **Bundle services**
   ```
   Full automation solution: $X/month
   (includes: setup, maintenance, optimization)
   ```

**[PRICING Tiers - 2 min]**

Create tiers to capture different budgets:

```
Starter: $997 (one-time)
────────────────────
- 1 automation
- Basic setup
- 30-day support

Pro: $2,997/month
────────────────────
- 3 automations
- Priority support
- Monthly optimization
- Ongoing maintenance

Agency: $5,997/month
────────────────────
- Unlimited automations
- Dedicated manager
- Custom development
- SLA guarantee
```

### Lesson 5.3: Recurring Revenue Models (10 minutes)

**[INTRO - 1 min]**

Recurring revenue is the key to building a valuable business.

In this lesson:
- Why retainers beat one-time projects
- What to include in retainers
- How to increase client value over time

Let's go.

**[WHY RECURRING REVENUE - 2 min]**

**One-time revenue:**
```
Year 1: $10,000
Year 2: $0 (new clients needed)
Year 3: $0 (new clients needed)
```

**Recurring revenue:**
```
Year 1: $24,000 ($2,000 × 12)
Year 2: $24,000 (they stay!)
Year 3: $24,000 (they stay!)
```

**After 3 years:**
- One-time: $10,000 total
- Recurring: $72,000 total

**The math:**
- 5 retainer clients × $2,000/month = $10,000/month
- = $120,000/year
- Work with 10 clients instead of 50

**[WHAT TO INCLUDE - 3 min]**

**Retainer Package:**

```
Monthly Retainer: $2,000/month

INCLUDES:
─────────

1. **Quarterly reviews**

2. Can't see results (20%)
3. Price (15%)
4. Other (5%)

Solutions:
- Regular reporting
- Show concrete savings
- Be worth more than you cost
```

**[UPSELLING EXISTING CLIENTS - 2 min]**

Increase revenue from existing clients:

**Natural upsells:**
- More automations
- Additional team members
- New use cases
- Expanded scope

**Trigger moments:**
- After showing success
- During quarterly review
- When they mention pain points

**Offer framework:**
```
"Based on what you've accomplished with X,
adding Y would help you achieve Z.

It's an additional $X/month.
Want me to put together a plan?"
```
