## Problem Section

### The Trap

You're tired. You've tried:
- Freelancing (feels like trading hours for dollars)
- SaaS (too much competition, too long to build)
- Affiliate marketing (saturated, soul-crushing)
- Content creation (algorithm games, burnout)

**You want freedom. Not another job.**

---

### The Opportunity

What if you could:
- Build AI agents that bring in money 24/7
- Charge premium prices for automation services
- Scale without hiring employees
- Launch in days, not months

**That's not a fantasy. It's the new reality.**

## Social Media Posts

### Twitter Thread Hook

🧵 I built a $5k/mo automation business in 3 months.
Here's is exactly how I did it (no coding required):

### Post 2

The old way to build a business:
- Learn to code
- Hire developers
- Spend $50k+

The new way:
- Use AI agents
- No code needed
- Cost: $50/mo

The future belongs to builders. Not coders.

### Post 3

I just realized:
- Employees cost $4k+/month
- AI agents cost $50/month
- Employees sleep. AI doesn't.

The math is insane.
