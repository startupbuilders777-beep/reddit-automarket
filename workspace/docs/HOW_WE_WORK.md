# How We Work Together - System Design

## The Goal
Build multiple AI/SaaS products efficiently using agent swarm. Each product = separate project with tasks.

---

## Project Types

| Type | Example | Goal |
|------|----------|------|
| **Sample Apps** | Demo landing pages | Validate ideas quickly |
| **MVPs** | AgentWatch, NexusAI | Build to launch |
| **Courses** | Whop Course | Create & sell |

---

## How Tasks Work

### Step 1: I Create Project
```
1. SPEC.md - What we're building
2. QUEUE.md - Task list
3. Start with 10-20 tickets
```

### Step 2: I Spawn Agent
```
- Agent reads SPEC.md
- Agent picks next task
- Agent builds
- Agent updates progress
```

### Step 3: You Review
```
- Agent reports back
- You see what's done
- You approve or request changes
```

## How I Analyze Myself (The Ralph Loop)

After each session, I should:

1. **What went well?**
   - Tasks completed
   - Code quality
   - Speed

2. **What failed?**
   - Errors encountered
   - Blockers
   - Mistakes

3. **How to improve?**
   - Better prompts
   - Different approach
   - More validation

4. **Metrics to track**
   - Tasks per hour
   - Token usage
   - Error rate

---

## Task Lifecycle

```
[Idea] → [Spec] → [Queue] → [Build] → [Review] → [Deploy]
```

1. **Idea** - You give me a concept
2. **Spec** - I write SPEC.md
3. **Queue** - I break into tasks
4. **Build** - Agents build
5. **Review** - You check
6. **Deploy** - Go live

## How We Communicate

| Channel | Use |
|---------|-----|
| #general | Quick updates |
| #builds | Code discussions |
| #ideas | New concepts |

---

## What I Need From You

| Input | Example |
|-------|---------|
| **Ideas** | "Build an AI agent monitor" |
| **Feedback** | "Make the button bigger" |
| **Approvals** | "Yes, deploy it" |
| **Context** | "Target is SMB market" |

---

## What You Get From Me

| Output | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **Progress** | "AgentWatch is 50% done" |
| **Options** | "We could build A or B" |
| **Research** | "Competitors charge $29/mo" |
| **Code** | Working Next.js app |

---

## Self-Analysis Prompts

After each session, I should ask:

1. "What did I build?"
2. "What problems did I hit?"
3. "How would I do it better?"
4. "What's the next step?"

---

## Your Turn

Now you can:
1. Give me an idea
2. Ask me to analyze my work
3. Request improvements to how I work
4. Approve/reject what I've built

---

## Current Sample Apps Running

| App | Agent | Status |
|-----|-------|---------|
| AgentWatch Lite | sample-agentwatch-lite | Building |
| OpenClaw Lite | sample-openclaw-lite | Building |
| AgentCloud IAAS | sample-agentcloud | Building |

Should be done in a few minutes!
