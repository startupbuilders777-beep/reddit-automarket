# Ideas Ranking

## Correction: Nexus vs Mission Control

### What is Nexus?
- **NexusAI** = LLM Data Platform
- "Put your data in every AI's brain"
- Different from AgentWatch - it's about feeding data TO AI, not monitoring AI

### What is Mission Control?
- Our internal dashboard
- Shows all projects, tasks, agents
- Located at: `projects/mission-control/`

## My Recommendation

### Build Order:

**Phase 1 (Now):**
1. **AgentWatch** - Fastest to build, validate, easy to understand
2. **OpenClaw Lite** - Leverages what we know (OpenClaw)

**Phase 2 (After validation):**
3. **AgentFleet** - Enterprise upsell
4. **OpenClaw Secure** - Docker-based privacy

**Phase 3 (Later):**
5. **AgentCloud IAAS** - If we want infrastructure play
