## Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Gap |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| Word Count | 3,500 | 8,000+ | -4,500 |
| Diagrams | 0 | 7+ | -7 |

## Recommendation

**Proceed with expansion** focusing on high-priority rewrites first. The book's foundation is sound - the work is depth, credibility, and visual support. Estimated effort: 4-5 hours of additional writing + diagram coordination.
