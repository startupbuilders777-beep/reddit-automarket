### The Simplest Automation: Daily Reminders

**Use case:** Get a daily summary every morning at 9am.

```

That's it.

### Automation 2: Research Bot

**Prompt:**
```
When I ask "research [topic]", find the top 5 articles, summarize each in 2 sentences, and post links.
```

**Example:**
> "research AI coding tools"

Agent responds with curated results.

### Automation 3: Content Aggregator

## Chapter 4: Building Your AI Team

One agent is an employee. A team is a company.

### The Swarm Structure

| Agent | Name | Responsibility |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **Researcher** | Nova | Finds opportunities, monitors trends |
| **Builder** | Forge | Codes, builds, creates |
| **QA** | Check | Reviews, tests, catches errors |
| **Deploy** | Ship | Gets things live |

### How They Talk
- Researcher finds something → notifies Builder
- Builder codes → notifies QA
- QA approves → notifies Deploy
- Deploy ships → reports to you

### Setting This Up

**Channel Strategy:**
- #research - Nova posts trends
- #builds - Forge works on projects
- #qa - Check reviews code
- #deploys - Ship handles hosting
