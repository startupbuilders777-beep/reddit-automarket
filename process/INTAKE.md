```
DISCOVER → TRIAGE → ASANA → EXECUTE → COMPLETE
    ↑                                      ↓
    └──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Self-Service Rules

1. **Any agent can pick up** unassigned Asana tasks
2. **No approval needed** to start Ready tasks
3. **Always update Asana** - it's the source of truth
4. **Log progress** - comments help the next agent

## Task Status Flow (Asana)

```
Not Started → In Progress → Completed
                  ↓
              Blocked
```

**Statuses map to Asana:**
- Not Started = "Not Started"
- In Progress = "In Progress"  
- Blocked = Add to task description
- Completed = Marked complete

---

*The loop never stops.*
