## Workflow

1. **Discover** → Ideas go to #ideas Discord channel
2. **Triage** → Killer decides priority, creates Asana task
3. **Ready** → Tasks sit in Asana waiting to be picked up
4. **Execute** → Agent claims task, works, updates status
5. **Complete** → Task marked done in Asana

## Agent Commands

### Check Asana for tasks
```bash
# List all incomplete tasks
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $ASANA_TOKEN" \
  "https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/tasks?project=1213277278397665&completed=false"
```
