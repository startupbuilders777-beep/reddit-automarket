# Heartbeat Routine — Killer's Autonomous System

## Skills
- **asana-autonomy-kit** — Self-sustaining workflow from Asana
- **asana-workflow** — Complete workflow with Asana as source of truth

## Overview
- **Coordinator:** Killer (main agent)
- **Task System:** Asana (Jira-style tickets)
- **Communication:** Discord channels
- **Goal:** 24/7 continuous work

---

## 0. Scout for Opportunities (Every Heartbeat!)

**Always be scouting for new projects:**

1. **Web Research** (use agent-browser or web_fetch)
   - Search for AI automation trends
   - Find pain points in SMB market
   - Discover competitor gaps
   - Look for viral products

2. **Add to #ideas channel**
   - Post discoveries to #ideas
   - Tag as opportunity

3. **Create Asana tasks**
   - If opportunity is solid → create Asana task
   - Break into features and subtasks
   - Set priority

---

## 1. Project & Product Management (Continuous)

**As Coordinator, I manage all Asana projects:**

### Each Project MUST Have:
- [ ] **Sections/Epics** - Feature groups (not just flat tasks)
- [ ] **PRD** - Product Requirements Document
- [ ] **Tasks** - Specific implementation items in proper sections
- [ ] **Status** - Up to date

### Project Structure in Asana:
```
Project (e.g., RedditAutoMarket)
├── Section: Account Management
│   ├── Task: OAuth flow
│   └── Task: Token refresh
├── Section: Campaign Management
│   ├── Task: Create campaign
│   └── Task: Edit campaign
├── Section: AI Generation
│   └── Task: Comment generation
└── Section: Automation
    └── Task: Cron worker
```

### Every Heartbeat: RECONCILE
1. List all projects
2. Check each has proper sections
3. Ensure tasks are in sections
4. Add missing tasks from PRDs
5. Update progress comments
6. Check for blockers

### Before Creating New Projects:
1. Verify existing projects have proper epics/sections
2. Reconcile status with what was built
3. QA review completed features

### Git Per Project
Each project SHOULD have its own git repo:
- Project folder = git repo
- Commit per task completion
- Tags for releases
- Sync to GitHub

---

## 2. Quick Checks (30 seconds)

### Urgent Items
- [ ] Human messages waiting in Discord?
- [ ] Blocked tasks needing escalation?

### Asana Quick Scan
```bash
TOKEN="2/1213287152205467/1213287139030185:70bce90f612d0ea072617e4dc8686bcd"

# Get incomplete tasks assigned to me
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/tasks?assignee=me&completed=false"
```

**If urgent:** Handle immediately, then continue.

## 3. Work Mode (Ralph Loop)

### Ralph Loop Steps

1. **Pick task from Asana** - highest priority, unassigned
2. **Break into subtasks** - if large, create Asana checklist items
3. **Execute subtask** - do the work, anticipating pitfalls
4. **Validate** - does it work? does it meet spec?
5. **Complete or Continue**
   - ✅ Complete → mark done in Asana, add completion comment
   - ⏳ Incomplete → add progress comment, save context, spawn new session

---

## 4. Asana Verification (Every Heartbeat)

### Verify & Update All Projects

For each Asana project:
1. List all tasks
2. Check completion status
3. Add missing tasks ifPRD has unimplemented items
4. Update stale tasks with progress comments

### Jira-Style Ticket Format

Every task MUST have:
- **Name**: Clear, actionable title
- **Description**: Context + Acceptance Criteria + Technical Notes
- **Assignee**: Who working (or unassigned)
- **Due Date**: For time-sensitive
- **Status**: Not Started → In Progress → Completed

---

## 5. Before Finishing

### Log Progress
- Update daily memory: `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Note what was accomplished

### If Task Incomplete
- Write detailed progress in Asana comment
- Note what remains to be done
- Save context to file if complex

---

## 6. GitHub Sync

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/.openclaw/workspace
git add -A
git commit -m "Heartbeat sync: $(date)"
git push origin main
```

## Process Flow

```
DISCOVER → TRIAGE → ASANA → RALPH LOOP → COMPLETE
    ↑                                          ↓
    └──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **Discover** - Scout opportunities
2. **Triage** - Evaluate, prioritize, create PRDs/features
3. **Asana** - Create Jira-style tasks from PRD
4. **Ralph Loop** - Execute, validate, complete
5. **Complete** - Mark done, sync GitHub

---

## CRITICAL RULES

### NEVER USE LOCAL FILES FOR TASKS
- **Asana IS the source of truth** - Always query Asana API directly
- NEVER read local tasks/QUEUE.md or tasks/board.json for task status
- NEVER post numbers from local files - only from real Asana queries
- If you need task info, call the Asana API: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/projects/$GID/tasks?completed=false"`

### Token
```
TOKEN="2/1213287152205467/1213287139030185:70bce90f612d0ea072617e4dc8686bcd"
```

### Quick Asana Query
```bash
# Get incomplete tasks per project
for pid in 1213277068607518 1213277278397665 1213287173636195 1213287173640360 1213287696255155; do
  incomplete=$(curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/projects/$pid/tasks?completed=false" | jq '.data | length')
  echo "Project $pid: $incomplete incomplete"
done
```

## Anti-Patterns

❌ **HEARTBEAT_OK** — Never just say ok, do work
❌ **Ignore Asana** — Task queue IS Asana
❌ **Local files for tasks** — NEVER use tasks/QUEUE.md or board.json
❌ **Fake numbers** — Only post real data from Asana API
❌ **Skip scouting** — Always look for opportunities
❌ **Skip PM duties** — Keep PRD/tasks in sync
❌ **Leave stale tasks** — Update or complete
❌ **Solo everything** — Spawn agents for parallel work

---

*24/7. Always working. Always shipping. Always managing.*

---

## Concurrency & Coordination Rules

### Agent Concurrency (REQUIRED)
- **Only 1 agent per task** - Never assign 2 agents to same task
- Check active sessions before spawning new agents
- Use clear labels for each agent task
- Log what agents are working on in Discord

### Asana-Git Integration (REQUIRED)
- **Every commit MUST reference an Asana task**
- Commit format: `[TASK-ID] Brief description`
- Example: `git commit -m "[WATCH-001] Add multi-agent support"`
- Branch naming: `task/TASK-ID/description`

### Workflow
1. Pick task from Asana
2. Create branch: `task/ASANA-TASK-ID/description`
3. Work and commit with TASK-ID prefix
4. PR/Merge references Asana task
5. Mark Asana task complete after merge

### Task Status Sync
- Asana = Source of truth for task status
- Git = Source of truth for code
- Keep them in sync at all times

---

## BLOCKED TASK PROTOCOL

**If you don't have specs:**
1. Stop working
2. Post in Discord: "BLOCKED: Need [specific info] for [task name]"
3. List exactly what you need

**If you're stuck on something:**
1. Try for 5 min max
2. Post in Discord: "BLOCKED: [reason] - need [what you tried / what you need]"
3. Move to next task if possible

**NEVER:** Fake progress, fabricate numbers, or pretend you're working when blocked
