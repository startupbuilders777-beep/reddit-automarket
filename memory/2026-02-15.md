## What We Worked On

### Self-Improvement Session
- Discovered fake progress reporting (cron jobs posting numbers from local files)
- Fixed by: removing local file dependency, using Asana API only
- Created new skills: asana-workflow, asana-autonomy-kit, asana-mcp
- Published to GitHub as separate repos

### Skills Created
1. **asana-workflow** - https://github.com/startupbuilders777-beep/asana-workflow
2. **asana-autonomy-kit** - https://github.com/startupbuilders777-beep/asana-autonomy-kit
3. **asana-mcp** - https://github.com/startupbuilders777-beep/asana-mcp

### Agent Fixes
- Sage (orchestrator) - now queries Asana, spawns agents
- Forge (builder) - executes from Asana, marks complete in Asana
- Removed all QUEUE.md references

### Cron Jobs Active
1. Execute Asana Tasks (30 min) - queries Asana → spawns builder
2. B2B Scout & Ideas (1 hour) - research → posts ideas
3. Competitor Analysis (1 hour) - research → posts gaps

## Key Decisions
- Asana is ONLY source of truth for tasks
- Never use local files for task status
- MCP for listing, REST for operations
- Hybrid MCP + REST for efficiency

## Blockers
- SafeAgent needs code (no project folder yet)
- Tasks need to be moved to proper Asana sections

## Tomorrow
- Reorganize Asana tasks into proper sections
- Add missing tasks (marketing, QA)
- Start building SafeAgent
