## System Setup Complete

### Distributed Agent System

**Core Principles:**
1. Asana is ONLY source of truth for work (tasks = truth)
2. Every piece of work is an Asana task
3. Asana IS the concurrency coordinator (assign to lock, unassign to release)
4. GitHub is source of truth for code
5. Self-improvement mandatory
6. Never use local files for state

### Cron Jobs (7 total)

| Job | Frequency | Purpose |
|-----|-----------|----------|
| Execute Asana Tasks | 30 min | Query Asana → assign → spawn builder |
| B2B Scout & Ideas | 1 hour | Research → post ideas |
| Competitor Analysis | 1 hour | Research competitors → post gaps |
| QA Verification | 1 hour | Build projects → verify |
| GitHub Sync | 2 hours | Push code to repos |
| Reconciliation | 1 hour | Unassign stale tasks |
| Daily Memory | 24 hours | Log learnings |

### Discord Channels

| Channel | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| #general | Main coordination |
| #ideas | B2B ideas, competitor analysis |
| #qa | QA verification results |

### Project Repos

| Project | Asana GID | GitHub |
|---------|------------|--------|
| NexusAI | 1213277068607518 | nexus-ai |
| AgentWatch | 1213277278397665 | agentwatch |
| RedditAutoMarket | 1213287173640360 | reddit-automarket |
| SafeAgent | 1213287696255155 | safeagent |

### Agent Roles

| Agent | Role | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Sage | Orchestrator | Queries Asana, spawns agents |
| Forge | Builder | Executes tasks |
| Check | QA | Verifies builds |
| Deploy | DevOps | Deploys code |

### Skills

- **asana-workflow** - Main skill for Asana operations
- Self-improvement - Logs learnings

### What's Working

- ✅ Cron jobs executing
- ✅ Agents spawning
- ✅ Asana coordination (assign/unassign)
- ✅ Reconciliation for stale tasks
- ✅ GitHub repos per project

### What's Blocked

- None currently

### Gaps Identified

1. **No specialized Scout agent** - Need agent focused on profitability research
2. **No specialized Planner agent** - Break research into Asana tasks
3. **Projects need more marketing tasks** - Only dev tasks being worked

## Action Items

- [ ] Consider adding specialized Scout agent for research
- [ ] Add marketing tasks to Asana for each project
- [ ] Set up Mac mini with same cron jobs
